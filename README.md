# Fprime-SyncBench: High-Fidelity Digital Twin Bridge
This research project evaluates the performance of different data transport mechanisms within the NASA F´ (F Prime) framework. The goal is to identify the most efficient way to synchronise a model rocket's flight software (FSW) with a Digital Twin (DT) simulator.


### Project Motivation
Standard GDS telemetry and Events are often too slow for high-fidelity Digital Twin synchronisation. This project evaluates the performance of GDS transport mechanisms and engineers a custom Managed Buffer TCP/UDP Driver to provide a high-throughput, low-latency alternative.
